# Welcome

This is a technical challange for wallapop.

# Considerations

I wanted to add value to the technical test, so I allowed myself to create simulated calls with query params to the endpoint you passed me. I know it could have been simplified by making the filters in a service. But I think this way you can see that I have mastery over several topics.

# How to run the project
